Relocated this site to an `AWS S3`_ `bucket`_ just now. Trying to set up `cross-region replication`_ as well. Have been considering custom building a monitoring and disaster recovery bot to automatically update DNS records in the event of a regional failure. Future versions could even integrate `Google Public Cloud`_ (whenever I get an account there) and `RackSpace Cloud Files`_.
