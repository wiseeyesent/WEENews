.. description: Switched to the "Zen" theme & pushed the site to GitHub 
.. type: text

Switched over to the `Zen`_ theme, which I'd previously tried out on my `dev`_ site. I like the format since it appears to be more mobile friendly. I wonder if anyone has a search bar I can utilize... Maybe just better organization here.

The site has also been pushed to my `GitHub`_ The dev site already existed there, so I'm catching up with this news page and then will do the `games`_ page next. Homepage will probably stay as it, but I need to make it text browser friendly.
