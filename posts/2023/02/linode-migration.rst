.. type: text

Managed to hose my aws personal server in the course of a certification class. I've relocated to linode, as I was planning on doing anyways. The `games. <https://games.wiseeyesent.com/>`_ & `news. <https://news.wiseeyesent.com>`_ pages are still being served from s3 via cloudfront, but I'd like to migrate those over to linode or Backblaze as well.

The really nice thing about finally getting off of Amazon Linux is letsencrypt is fully supported now, so yay, new SSL certs.
