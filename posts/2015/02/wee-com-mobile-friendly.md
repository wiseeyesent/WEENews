<html><body><p>I've pushed a new update to <a title="WiseEyes Enterprise" href="https://www.wiseeyesent.com">WisEyes Enterprise</a>Â using "Responsive Design" as described by W3School's excellent <a title="W3Schools Bootstrap 3 Tutorial" href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/default.asp" target="_blank">Bootstrap tutorial</a>. The page now takes advantage of Bootstrap's multi-screen size, columnar layout in order to create a dynamic flow that automatically shifts from standard display to a single column depending on the window size. Additionally, the font has been slightly modified although all links and site layout have remained the same.

With these recent updates to <a href="https://www.wiseeyesent.com">WEE.com</a> &amp; <a title="Games &amp; Projects by WiseEyes Ent." href="https://games.wiseeyesent.com">Games.WEE</a>, the next step will be back to active planning and development on the WEEChing &amp; WEESnake projects. As always, feel free to provide me with any feedback that you have.</p></body></html>
