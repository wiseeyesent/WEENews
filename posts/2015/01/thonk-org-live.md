<html><body><p>My brother's project, <a title="Thonk - User Friendly Roadmap of Science" href="http://thonk.org" target="_blank">Thonk</a>, has expanded its presence on the web with a site I implemented and he populated. The project itself is pretty awesome. He aims to create a "user friendly roadmap of science" wherein a user created database of science is built. Users can enter theories and add supporting content, i.e. studies, that weigh the "viability" of the given topic. The idea is pretty awesome and he could really use some help, so please check out their <a title="Thonk Github" href="https://github.com/ThonkTeam/Thonk" target="_blank">Github page</a> for the repo or followÂ their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/THONK/258177714363949" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p></body></html>
