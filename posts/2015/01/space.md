<html><body><p>As part of a <a title="CodeCademy Solar System" href="https://www.codecademy.com/scriptNinja52950/codebits/C9whhT" target="_blank">CodeCademy project</a>, I've built a simple rendition of our solar system's major planets.
<a title="Space by WEE" href="http://games.wiseeyesent.com/games/space/" target="_blank">http://games.wiseeyesent.com/games/space/</a>

I've incorporated relative velocity for all orbits based off of the Earth using a set time frame of 10s == 1 Earth Year. The inner planets and outer planets have sizes relative to each other, but not amongst the two groups. The Sun and planet distances are not to scale at all. I've tried to <a title="GTMetrix Optimization Report" href="/GTmetrix-report-www.wiseeyesent.com-20170414T200205.pdf" target="_blank">optimize</a> the page as much as possible, although no CDN has been incorporated. Additionally, it's a large volume of animation, so it may run sluggish on some computers. Performance is better if you zoom out to about 50% scale.</p></body></html>
