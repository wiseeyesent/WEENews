Since my AWS free tier ran out a while ago, I'm probably going to be migrating all of this to cheaper hosting. I really only have one site that requires server side processing. Most of the rest already lives on S3. I think I'm going to try and build this network out in a sort of reverse Disaster Recovery (DR) fashion.
