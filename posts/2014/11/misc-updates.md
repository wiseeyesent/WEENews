<html><body><p>Today, I will be performing general website updates and design work on my WEESnake 2.0 project. Additional work may also be performed upon the new WEEChing web app. Primary updates involve theme changes to this news page and updating the WiseEyesEnt website to use design pages instead of generic placeholders for my personal projects. In this way, I hope to integrate transparency with my audience by permitting my visitors to see my progress and course of action rather than a "coming soon" message.

Please feel free to contact me at any time regarding recommendations or requests.
