<html><body><p>I've started documentation for a sequel to WEESnake. This title will include online multi-player with a focus upon cross-platform support. Initial design will target Android devices and a web app. A new page has been created to help relay progress on this project.

<a title="WEESnake 2" href="/pages/projects/wees2.html">More information available here...</a>

Additionally, I have finally gotten the default "Hello, World" app provided with the Google Android Studio IDE to compile and run on my Evo 4G LTE. Prior development experiments relied upon the Virtual Machine, making testing far too cumbersome for efficient development. Current utilization of the ADB driver for debugging purposes will permit WEESnake2 development to proceed unhindered.</p></body></html>
