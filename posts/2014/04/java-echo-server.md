Today, I created a simple echo server

It was written by modifying a tutorial available on the Oracle site for socket programming. This is the first step to writing an authentication system capable of storing multiple users with secure login credentials and permitting these users to login to the system with an encrypted password. The project itself is a school lab for one of my co-workers and is being pursued both to assist my co-worker as well as to learn this type of system on my own.
