<a title="WEEMonster" href="http://games.wiseeyesent.com/games/weemonster/" target="_blank">WEEMonster v1.0</a>

This project is an AI engine built using a very simple, 3 state Finite State Machine. The monster is capable of being in the "Hide", "Attack" &amp; "Flee" states while the player simply exists or not &amp; attacks as long as he does exist. Future versions may incorporate multiple players attacking a lone monster at once, multiple player classes or the ability to modify the monster statistics &amp; abilities.

Don't hold you're breath on that though. This was just a simple project for practicing FSM for implementing AI engines so I'm more focused on finishing the text I'm reading through instead of refining this project.</p></body></html>
