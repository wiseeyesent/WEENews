<html><body><p>New perl script release, <a title="WEEChing" href="https://games.wiseeyesent.com/projects/games/weeching/" target="_blank">WEEChing</a>! (<a title="WEEChing Source" href="https://games.wiseeyesent.com/files/weeching" target="_blank">Source</a>)

This nifty, little perl script generates an <a title="I Ching - Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching" target="_blank">I Ching</a> hexagram, with changing lines, and then displays a reading for the hexagram, the relevant lines and the resulting hexagram. The readings are provided courtesy of <a title="I Ching by Wilhelm - Deoxy.org" href="https://deoxy.org/iching" target="_blank">deoxy.org</a> and are retrieved with the cURL utility, parsed by string splitting and embedded into an HTML page that the user is redirected to. This is the first full version of the program, although  it has been in development for some time now. The code itself still needs to be thoroughly cleaned &amp; further organized, but the functionality is there with no bugs witnessed in  the present version. Please feel free to report any requests or issues encountered at any time by email, comment or otherwise.

NOTE: Deoxy.org does have its own random I Ching reading <a title="Random I Ching - Deoxy.org" href="https://deoxy.org/iching/random" target="_blank">here</a>

EDIT: Updated weeching link to the stand-alone page</p></body></html>
