<html><body><p>Thank you for sticking with me during my early days @ jcripe.mydevryportfolio.com. Due to a recent hiring @ HostGator.com &amp; their generosity, including an interest in equipping me with the tools my customers use, I have acquired a webspace! :D <a href="https://wiseeyesent.com/">WiseEyesEnt.com</a>

Included is this WordPress, which I'm not exactly sure what to post, other than the overdue content I had intended to post on TUMBLR.

For now, you can enjoy this screen shot of my first game, <a href="https://games.wiseeyesent.com">WEESnake</a>:
