<html><body><p>Due to finishing classes and my circadian rhythms being fucked by my night job, I have now just completed the latest release of <a title="WEE Games" href="https://games.wiseeyesent.com" target="_blank">WEESnake</a>! You might also notice a brand new <a title="WiseEyes Ent HOME" href="https://wiseeyesent.com">splash page</a>, courtesy of BaseKit Site Builder. I've had some ideas for what to do with the webpage, but school has been keeping me pretty busy so far. In my free time, mostly at work, I've also been practicing a little bit of Perl programming in an attempt to hone my skills for a position on the development team. I'll introduce a perl page or general programming page soon. In the mean time, since I've finally incorporated the high score board on WEESnake, it's time for me to get to work planning my next project, "Z"...
