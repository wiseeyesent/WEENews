<html><body><p>School is nearing it's end, preliminary documentation has already been drawn up, a plan is in place an there are parties interested in participating in the Zed Project. The time has come to open planning to the public. I've set up a new forum (thanks to the folks at bbPress) you can find linked on the <a href="http://games.wiseeyesent.com/">Games page</a> or directly <a href="http://games.wiseeyesent.com/games/zed/">here</a>. Registration is open &amp; free, but discussion will be moderated by myself. Any &amp; all input or participation is greatly appreciated! I'll be posting the preliminary docs when I have the time. All of them will be reviewed and revised to ensure accuracy, completeness and readability.</p></body></html>
