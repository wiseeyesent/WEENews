<html><body><p>I've been working on a school project for a few weeks now, which I don't think I've mentioned yet. You can see progress &amp; updates at <a href="https://wiseeyesent.com/gsp475">http://wiseeyesent.com/gsp475</a> or through the new Menu Item listed here (points to the same place). I'm working on setting up a cloud storage service using OwnCloud. Hopefully, I'll be able to replace my Dropbox account with this OwnCloud service, although it may be good to maintain the additional account just for the sake of off-site backups of my work here. As part of this project, I'm also working on configuring a web server from Thor, my home computer. Hopefully, within the next few weeks, <a href="https://wee.wiseeyesent.com/">http://wee.wiseeyesent.com/</a> will become live.</p></body></html>
