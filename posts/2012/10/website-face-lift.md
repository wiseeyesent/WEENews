<html><body><p>Have you noticed the new changes yet?

That's right, folks, I'm redoing my website. The original was built using BaseKit SiteBuilder (<a href="https://www.basekit.com/">http://www.basekit.com/</a>) which is extremely simple to us with its point and click interface. However, BaseKit relies upon a redirection method instead of publishing the files to your hosting account, and can introduce its own problems as well. In the interest of learning (and my [in]sanity), I'm redoing the site by custom coding my pages.

Of course I'm still using WordPress for this news page, but the rest are by my own hand.

Portions of the site were already my own work, in particular the <a href="https://wiseeyesent.com/dev">/dev</a> &amp; <a href="https://wiseeyesent.com/folio">/folio</a> sections. Now I'm redoing the <a title="/caffeine" href="https://wiseeyesent.com/caffeine">/caffeine</a>Â page still, but the home page itself has already been updated.
Please feel free to send me any feedback you have on the site.

EDIT 20121030: Finished the new <a title="/caffeine" href="https://wiseeyesent.com/caffeine">/caffeine</a> page, so the website is now functional! I'll probably work on integrating a mail form next, once I figure out captchas.</p></body></html>
