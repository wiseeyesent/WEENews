So, while weeSnake is in the final iterations of development (still working on a persistent high score board for the online version) the next WiseEyes Enterprise project is in the planning stages at this time.

Project: "Z" aka "Zed"

Premise: Zombie Side-Scroller, 8-bit, Mario meets zombies

Goal: Traverse level from start to finish while avoiding, incapacitating, killing or infecting any humans in the way

Description: The player will control "Zed", just your slightly smarter than average undead ghoul, as he traverses 2-d levels and attempts to outwit, out-maneuver and otherwise catch the humans unawares. Humans are capable of quickly killing the player, both at a range and in close proximity. Attacking humans takes time, and leaves the player vulnerable. Infecting humans, may or may not, result in zombie allies.

Controls: WASD interface or arrow keys, plus Space bar, Ctrl, Alt, etc.

Abilities: Walk, crawl, feign death (detectable), burrow (not detectable), scratch, bite, devour (restore health? currently undecided)

 

TEAM MEMBERS:

Currently, I have a few friends and individuals interested in helping out with the project, primarily with the programming aspects (writing the game in Java). The game will need a graphics engine, sound engine, NPC (Human &amp; Zombie) AI engine as all as the overall game engine. This project will also require a 2-d artist and level designer, may need a concept artist, will require a sound artist for effects, ambiance and music.

SLOTS:

Graphics Programmer - OPEN

Sound Programmer - OPEN

2-D/Concept Artist - OPEN
