<p>Today, I will be performing general website updates and design work on my WEESnake 2.0 project. Additional work may also be performed upon the new WEEChing web app. Primary updates involve theme changes to this news page and updating the WiseEyesEnt website to use design pages instead of generic placeholders for my personal projects. In this way, I hope to integrate transparency with my audience by permitting my visitors to see my progress and course of action rather than a "coming soon" message.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact me at any time regarding recommendations or requests.</p>
<p>-Admin/Dev</p>
<p>UPDATES COMPLETED:
- Integrated Favicon on News.WEE.com
- Updated News.WEE.com color scheme and header images
- Updated Test.WEE.com/Games
- Updated Test.WEE.com/Games/WEESnake</p>

<p>In case you haven't noticed by now, deoxy.org has been down for some time. I was hoping it would only be temporary, but that does not seem to be the case. WEEChing was built using requests to deoxy.org/iching for its readings, which were then parsed by the app. As a result, WEEChing itself is down at the moment.</p>
<p>Old libraries of these readings are available from when I originally built my Java and Objective-C I Ching applications. I'll need to redesign WEEChing to use a local/remote database instead, but I wanted to do this for the sake of supporting user profiles anyways. Further updates will be provided when I have time to address this project.</p>

<p>EDIT: Current release is v0.7a. Work on this project is halted at the moment as the Java Virtual Machine itself is consuming too much memory for feasible use on my VPS. The project will need to be restarted using Perl, C++ or another alternative with lower over-head. Possbilities also include a web interface since it's going to be rebuilt anyways.</p>
<p>EDIT: v0.5c is now out with support for File Downloads &amp; Uploads</p>
<p>WEEUp v0.5 has been released. Find the Git Repo here: <a title="WEEUp v0.5 Repo" href="https://github.com/wiseeyesent/WEEUp" target="_blank">https://github.com/wiseeyesent/WEEUp</a></p>
<p>This is an encrypted File Uploader. Currently using SKIP protocol to instantiate a shared DES encryption key. It comes in 2 parts, the server, WEEUpD, and the client WEEUp. The server is not directly interactive and must be connected to with the client in order for any operations to be performed. Each can be run out of an entirely unique directory. Currently, the server will create a passwd file containing all registered usernames and their password hashes, as well as a new directory for each user that is created. Files uploaded by the client are automatically stored in the user's directory.</p>
<p>The server is designed to be multi-threaded to support multiple concurrent connections. However, due to the memory limits of my VPS and the memory consumption of Java, I have been unable to fully test this. Additionally, no testing has been performed upon anything other than CentOS. It should run equally well in similar *nix systems, but I have not verified this. Ideally, it should also run on Windows &amp; Mac OSX with Java 7 or higher, but this has yet to be tested either.</p>
<p>At this time, the program logs all statements to standard output, so the display can become rather convoluted very quickly. Future versions will incorporate logging to a separate file as well as the verbosity level to use for logging. Additionally, I plan to incorporate a feature for emailing the session logs upon quitting as well as options for selecting different encryption ciphers, key lengths, and initial parameters.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any requests or bugs. You can contact me by email or through the Git Repo.</p>

<p>EDIT: This project has been lost</p>
<p>Completed a new multi-threaded program in about 30 minutes on my lunch break. This is a predecessor to incorporating multi-threading within my previous client/server socket program. The next step will be to establish a communication protocol, followed by the login system and finally encryption.</p>
<p>EDIT: I successfully updated my SocketServer program to use a Multi-Threaded system, but it crashes when the second thread is started. This is what happens when you run Java on an introductory level VPS. Will try again in Perl or C.</p>

<p>Today, I created a simple echo server</p>
<p>It was written by modifying a tutorial available on the Oracle site for socket programming. This is the first step to writing an authentication system capable of storing multiple users with secure login credentials and permitting these users to login to the system with an encrypted password. The project itself is a school lab for one of my co-workers and is being pursued both to assist my co-worker as well as to learn this type of system on my own.</p>

<p>NOTE: This is a cross post from my Tumblr. It was originally uploaded on January 26th, 2012. This  level was originally conceived as an underground pit/abandoned mine that has been converted to an arena for blood sport, Unreal Tournament style. I really enjoyed designing the level, particularly the lighting work with the sky light and the use of solid meshes for adding personality as well as providing cover.</p>
<p>This past week, I have successfully created my first original map for Unreal Tournament 3 using the UDK Beta (2009-11 version) as part of a school assignment. Here is a brief walkthrough with extensive screen shots of the level.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_01_Spawn.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-399"><img class="alignnone wp-image-399 size-medium" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_01_Spawn-300x241.jpg" alt="UDK-2012-01-ThePit_01_Spawn" width="300" height="241"></a></p>
<p>This is what the player sees upon initial spawn. I’ve hidden the spawn point behind a large piece of machinery to provide some cover for the player so that he or she isn’t instantly fragged the moment they enter the world.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_02_SpawnView.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-400"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-400" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_02_SpawnView-300x241.jpg" alt="UDK-2012-01-ThePit_02_SpawnView" width="300" height="241"></a></p>
<p>This is a view of the first room from the end of the machinery covering the initial spawn point. You can’t really see it in this screen shot, but there is a rocket launcher directly ahead of the player, just to the right of the crosshairs (next to the big tanks the player is staring at).</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_03_SpawnShieldBelt.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-401"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-401" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_03_SpawnShieldBelt-300x241.jpg" alt="UDK-2012-01-ThePit_03_SpawnShieldBelt" width="300" height="241"></a></p>
<p>This is the shield belt hidden behind the rubble directly in front of the player spawn point. It is just to the right of the player in the previous screen shot. The shield belt provides 100 points of armor that completely covers the player, unlike the localized armor provided by the chest plate &amp; shin guards.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_04_SpawnRocketLauncher.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-402"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-402" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_04_SpawnRocketLauncher-300x241.jpg" alt="UDK-2012-01-ThePit_04_SpawnRocketLauncher" width="300" height="241"></a></p>
<p>The afore mentioned rocket launcher in the middle of the player’s spawn room. If you look behind the wall just ahead of the player, you find a nice surprise.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_05_SpawnSuperHealth.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-403"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-403" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_05_SpawnSuperHealth-300x241.jpg" alt="UDK-2012-01-ThePit_05_SpawnSuperHealth" width="300" height="241"></a></p>
<p>A super health pack behind the bunker wall in the corner of the player spawn room! Pick it up &amp; try looking behind the barrels along the wall.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_06_SpawnShockRifle.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-404"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-404" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_06_SpawnShockRifle-300x241.jpg" alt="UDK-2012-01-ThePit_06_SpawnShockRifle" width="300" height="241"></a></p>
<p>Here we find the shock rifle with quite a bit of ammo. Not as powerful as the rocket launcher, but more out of the way with ammo readily available, in case someone else has already grabbed the rocket launcher.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_07_SpawnRocketAmmo.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-405"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-405" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_07_SpawnRocketAmmo-300x241.jpg" alt="UDK-2012-01-ThePit_07_SpawnRocketAmmo" width="300" height="241"></a></p>
<p>After picking up the shock rifle, we turn back to the center of the main room to find the rocket launcher ammo at the top of the stairs. Instead of heading downstairs, we’ll continue to the back of the room.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_08_HallEntrance.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-406"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-406" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_08_HallEntrance-300x241.jpg" alt="UDK-2012-01-ThePit_08_HallEntrance" width="300" height="241"></a></p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_09_HallExit.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-407"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-407" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_09_HallExit-300x241.jpg" alt="UDK-2012-01-ThePit_09_HallExit" width="300" height="241"></a></p>
<p>At the back of the first room we find the hall, which we passed earlier when grabbing the rocket launcher &amp; super health.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_10_Statue.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-408"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-408" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_10_Statue-300x241.jpg" alt="UDK-2012-01-ThePit_10_Statue" width="300" height="241"></a></p>
<p>Which leads us to the statue room.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_11_StatueRocketAmmo.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-409"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-409" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_11_StatueRocketAmmo-300x241.jpg" alt="UDK-2012-01-ThePit_11_StatueRocketAmmo" width="300" height="241"></a></p>
<p>Look around and you’ll find two packs of extra rocket ammo.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_12_StatueView1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-410"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-410" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_12_StatueView1-300x241.jpg" alt="UDK-2012-01-ThePit_12_StatueView1" width="300" height="241"></a> <a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_13_StatueView2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-411"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-411" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_13_StatueView2-300x241.jpg" alt="UDK-2012-01-ThePit_13_StatueView2" width="300" height="241"></a></p>
<p>As well as some creepy statues.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_14_TunnelExit.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-412"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-412" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_14_TunnelExit-300x241.jpg" alt="UDK-2012-01-ThePit_14_TunnelExit" width="300" height="241"></a></p>
<p>Tunnel exit through the arch in the statue room which leads us too…</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_15_Bunker.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-413"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-413" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_15_Bunker-300x241.jpg" alt="UDK-2012-01-ThePit_15_Bunker" width="300" height="241"></a></p>
<p>The bunker room, named for the offset walls which provide some extra cover for those in the tunnel as well as mixing up the pacing in this room a little more.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_16_BunkerArmor.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-414"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-414" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_16_BunkerArmor-300x241.jpg" alt="UDK-2012-01-ThePit_16_BunkerArmor" width="300" height="241"></a></p>
<p>And concealing a couple pieces of armor, the chest plate &amp; shin guards.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_17_Stair.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-415"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-415" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_17_Stair-300x241.jpg" alt="UDK-2012-01-ThePit_17_Stair" width="300" height="241"></a></p>
<p>Leaving the bunker room takes us to the stair room.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_18_StairHealth.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-416"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-416" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_18_StairHealth-300x241.jpg" alt="UDK-2012-01-ThePit_18_StairHealth" width="300" height="241"></a></p>
<p>Where you can find an extra health pack if you keep your eyes open. The stairs lead us back up to the first room, making the map a closed circuit.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_19_SpawnSkylight.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-417"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-417" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/UDK-2012-01-ThePit_19_SpawnSkylight-300x241.jpg" alt="UDK-2012-01-ThePit_19_SpawnSkylight" width="300" height="241"></a></p>
<p>Quick peak of the skylight in the first room, providing all the orange light throughout the level.</p>
<p>Overhead views of the rooms in order of walkthrough traversal:</p>

<p>New project release!
<a title="WEEMonster" href="https://wiseeyesent.com/weemonster/" target="_blank">WEEMonster v1.0</a></p>
<p>This project is an AI engine built using a very simple, 3 state Finite State Machine. The monster is capable of being in the "Hide", "Attack" &amp; "Flee" states while the player simply exists or not &amp; attacks as long as he does exist. Future versions may incorporate multiple players attacking a lone monster at once, multiple player classes or the ability to modify the monster statistics &amp; abilities.</p>
<p>Don't hold you're breath on that though. This was just a simple project for practicing FSM for implementing AI engines so I'm more focused on finishing the text I'm reading through instead of refining this project.</p>

<p>New perl script release, <a title="WEEChing" href="https://games.wiseeyesent.com/projects/games/weeching/" target="_blank">WEEChing</a>! (<a title="WEEChing Source" href="https://games.wiseeyesent.com/files/weeching" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>This nifty, little perl script generates an <a title="I Ching - Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching" target="_blank">I Ching</a> hexagram, with changing lines, and then displays a reading for the hexagram, the relevant lines and the resulting hexagram. The readings are provided courtesy of <a title="I Ching by Wilhelm - Deoxy.org" href="https://deoxy.org/iching" target="_blank">deoxy.org</a> and are retrieved with the cURL utility, parsed by string splitting and embedded into an HTML page that the user is redirected to. This is the first full version of the program, although  it has been in development for some time now. The code itself still needs to be thoroughly cleaned &amp; further organized, but the functionality is there with no bugs witnessed in  the present version. Please feel free to report any requests or issues encountered at any time by email, comment or otherwise.</p>
<p>NOTE: Deoxy.org does have its own random I Ching reading <a title="Random I Ching - Deoxy.org" href="https://deoxy.org/iching/random" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>EDIT: Updated weeching link to the stand-alone page</p>
