<html><body><p>Finally, after 6 years spent at 2 different schools, I have completed my Bachelor's of Science degree! My last class with DeVry for the Game &amp; Simulation Programming program (a little redundant, no?) ended on February 28th. As a result, I now bring you the next game in my library, <a href="https://games.wiseeyesent.com/projects/games/ea52/">Escape from Area 52</a>! This project was intended to be a Beta release so it's still very buggy, particularly the sound effects, graphics and some NPC collision detection.

NEXT UP!
I'll be working on a standalone page for this title complete with documentation &amp; any possible future developments (highly unlikely, but I could get bored).

<a href="https://games.wiseeyesent.com/projects/games/zed/">Project Zed</a> is still in the works and now that I've finished school, I'll have more time to kick out something extra awesome, or at least playable.</p></body></html>
