<html><body><p>With the push of my <a title="WiseEyes Enterprise" href="https://www.wiseeyesent.com/" target="_blank">new home page</a> has come the opportunity to re-optimize the site. Currently, <a title="GTMetrix 20150121" href="/GTmetrix-report-www.wiseeyesent.com-20170414T200205.pdf" target="_blank">GTMetrix is reporting</a> a PageSpeed grade of 99% and YSlow reports 98%. The only major recommendation remaining is incorporating a CDN, which would likely improve the background display significantly. The advantage of flat HTML is clearly demonstrable in the 85%/89% scored by this News page as compared to the home page itself.

The Games page is still being reworked at this time to incorporate Frame for easier navigation. I have the basic structure outlined and am playing with a pallet currently with the help of my wife's artistic eye. The most distinct change from the old home page to the current version is two fold.

A) Use of "div" elements and CSS in place of a table for organization

B) Use of jQuery for dynamic link elements

I'm also working on mobile browser detection of a format that doesn't require a ridiculous number of additional .htaccess lines. I've considered using additional jQuery to load an alternate stylesheet for varying screen sizes, however nothing has been coded at this time.</p></body></html>
