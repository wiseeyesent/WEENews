Completed a new multi-threaded program in about 30 minutes on my lunch break. This is a predecessor to incorporating multi-threading within my previous client/server socket program. The next step will be to establish a communication protocol, followed by the login system and finally encryption.

EDIT: I successfully updated my SocketServer program to use a Multi-Threaded system, but it crashes when the second thread is started. This is what happens when you run Java on an introductory level VPS. Will try again in Perl or C.</p></body></html>
