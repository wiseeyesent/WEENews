<html><body><p>I've added a new plugin to WordPress, can you tell?

Yesterday, I successfully installed &amp; updated <a href="http://akismet.com/wordpress/">Akismet</a> for WordPress, which is a delightfully free (they accept donations from private users &amp; charge for businesses) spam blocking application. All you have to do is sign up for a key at their site, then provide it to your WordPress blog upon installation. Presto, change-o, you've got a spam free blog! All comments &amp; content submitted to your blog, excluding registered users of your blog, will be scrutinized by Akismet for validity.

Â 

Yay, delicious spam-free blogging!
