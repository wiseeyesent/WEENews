<html><body><p>Thank you for sticking with me during my early days @ jcripe.mydevryportfolio.com. Due to a recent hiring @ HostGator.com &amp; their generosity, including an interest in equipping me with the tools my customers use, I have acquired a webspace! :D <a href="https://www.wiseeyesent.com/">WiseEyesEnt.com</a>

Included is this WordPress, which I'm not exactly sure what to post, other than the overdue content I had intended to post on TUMBLR.

For now, you can enjoy this screen shot of my first game, <a href="https://games.wiseeyesent.com/">WEESnake</a>:

-- EDIT: 2017-04-16 The Tumblr this image was hosted on has been deleted for a while now and I don't recall ever downloading the image locally. Additionally, the game mentioned is outdated and no longer works on current systems. A new version was built with GameMaker Studio and the assistance of cohorts, but is only an alpha level test application.
