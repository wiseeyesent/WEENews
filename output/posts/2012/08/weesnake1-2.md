<html><body><p>The new version of WEESnake is now live on the <a title="WEESnake 1.2" href="http://games.wiseeyesent.com" target="_blank">games page</a>!

I've finally implemented a persistent high score board when playing it online embedded in a browser. Right now, only one of my testing scores is listed, so there's plenty of room for new scores!

I'm thinking of putting together a contents, but I haven't been able to decide a prize yet. Please feel free to send in requests. So far I've been mostly thinking of NewEgg gift cards, but I'm sure there's something more widely desired.</p></body></html>
