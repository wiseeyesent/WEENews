<html><body><p>Project Zed has been moved to a <a title="Project Zed" href="/pages/zed.html">permanent page</a>

Documentation for the project has just been turned in for final class credit &amp; is also available online: <a title="Project Zed Documentation" href="https://games.wiseeyesent.com/files/ProjectZed_Doc-Des.docx" target="_blank">http://games.wiseeyesent.com/files/ProjectZed_Doc-Des.docx</a>

This documentation is still pending further review &amp; revision, but will form the foundation for the project itself. Development may begin in the near future on coding &amp; game engine assets. Art assets and game levels still need volunteers.
