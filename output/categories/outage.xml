I was hoping it would only be temporary, but that does not seem to be the case. WEEChing was built using requests to deoxy.org/iching for its readings, which were then parsed by the app. As a result, WEEChing itself is down at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old libraries of these readings are available from when I originally built my Java and Objective-C I Ching applications. I'll need to redesign WEEChing to use a local/remote database instead, but I wanted to do this for the sake of supporting user profiles anyways. Further updates will be provided when I have time to address this project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>outage</category><category>Projects</category><category>WEEChing</category><guid>https://news.wiseeyesent.com/posts/2014/10/weeching-down.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2014 10:30:09 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
