The page now takes advantage of Bootstrap's multi-screen size, columnar layout in order to create a dynamic flow that automatically shifts from standard display to a single column depending on the window size. Additionally, the font has been slightly modified although all links and site layout have remained the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these recent updates to &lt;a href="https://www.wiseeyesent.com"&gt;WEE.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a title="Games &amp;amp; Projects by WiseEyes Ent." href="https://games.wiseeyesent.com"&gt;Games.WEE&lt;/a&gt;, the next step will be back to active planning and development on the WEEChing &amp;amp; WEESnake projects.

&lt;a title="Space by WEE" href="https://games.wiseeyesent.com/projects/games/space/" target="_blank"&gt;https://games.wiseeyesent.com/projects/games/space/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've incorporated relative velocity for all orbits based off of the Earth using a set time frame of 10s == 1 Earth Year. The inner planets and outer planets have sizes relative to each other, but not amongst the two groups. The Sun and planet distances are not to scale at all. I've tried to &lt;a title="GTMetrix Optimization Report" href="https://news.wiseeyesent.com/GTmetrix-report-www.wiseeyesent.com-20170414T200205.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;optimize&lt;/a&gt; the page as much as possible, although no CDN has been incorporated. Additionally, it's a large volume of animation, so it may run sluggish on some computers. Performance is better if you zoom out to about 50% scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- EDIT: 2017-04-16 GT Metrix report was re-run and may not match post description&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Announcements</category><category>Games</category><category>Projects</category><guid>https://news.wiseeyesent.com/posts/2015/01/space.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2015 20:16:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>New Project: WEESnake 2</title><link>https://news.wiseeyesent.com/posts/2014/11/new-wees2.html</link><dc:creator>admin</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've started documentation for a sequel to WEESnake. This title will include online multi-player with a focus upon cross-platform support. Initial design will target Android devices and a web app. A new page has been created to help relay progress on this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="WEESnake 2" href="https://news.wiseeyesent.com/pages/projects/wees2.html"&gt;More information available here...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I have finally gotten the default "Hello, World" app provided with the Google Android Studio IDE to compile and run on my Evo 4G LTE. Prior development experiments relied upon the Virtual Machine, making testing far too cumbersome for efficient development. Current utilization of the ADB driver for debugging purposes will permit WEESnake2 development to proceed unhindered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Announcements</category><category>Games</category><category>Projects</category><category>Updates</category><category>WEESnake</category><guid>https://news.wiseeyesent.com/posts/2014/11/new-wees2.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2014 00:51:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Miscellaneous Updates, Nov 2014</title><link>https://news.wiseeyesent.com/posts/2014/11/misc-updates.html</link><dc:creator>admin</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I will be performing general website updates and design work on my WEESnake 2.0 project. Additional work may also be performed upon the new WEEChing web app. Primary updates involve theme changes to this news page and updating the WiseEyesEnt website to use design pages instead of generic placeholders for my personal projects. In this way, I hope to integrate transparency with my audience by permitting my visitors to see my progress and course of action rather than a "coming soon" message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to contact me at any time regarding recommendations or requests.&lt;/p&gt;

I was hoping it would only be temporary, but that does not seem to be the case. WEEChing was built using requests to deoxy.org/iching for its readings, which were then parsed by the app. As a result, WEEChing itself is down at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old libraries of these readings are available from when I originally built my Java and Objective-C I Ching applications. I'll need to redesign WEEChing to use a local/remote database instead, but I wanted to do this for the sake of supporting user profiles anyways. Further updates will be provided when I have time to address this project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>outage</category><category>Projects</category><category>WEEChing</category><guid>https://news.wiseeyesent.com/posts/2014/10/weeching-down.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2014 10:30:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>WEEUp Client/Server File Uploader</title><link>https://news.wiseeyesent.com/posts/2014/06/weeup_0-5.html</link><dc:creator>admin</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Current release is v0.7a. Work on this project is halted at the moment as the Java Virtual Machine itself is consuming too much memory for feasible use on my VPS. The project will need to be restarted using Perl, C++ or another alternative with lower over-head. Possbilities also include a web interface since it's going to be rebuilt anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT: v0.5c is now out with support for File Downloads &amp;amp; Uploads&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WEEUp v0.5 has been released. Find the Git Repo here: &lt;a title="WEEUp v0.5 Repo" href="https://github.com/wiseeyesent/WEEUp" target="_blank"&gt;https://github.com/wiseeyesent/WEEUp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an encrypted File Uploader. Currently using SKIP protocol to instantiate a shared DES encryption key. It comes in 2 parts, the server, WEEUpD, and the client WEEUp. The server is not directly interactive and must be connected to with the client in order for any operations to be performed. Each can be run out of an entirely unique directory. Currently, the server will create a passwd file containing all registered usernames and their password hashes, as well as a new directory for each user that is created. Files uploaded by the client are automatically stored in the user's directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The server is designed to be multi-threaded to support multiple concurrent connections. However, due to the memory limits of my VPS and the memory consumption of Java, I have been unable to fully test this. Additionally, no testing has been performed upon anything other than CentOS. It should run equally well in similar *nix systems, but I have not verified this. Ideally, it should also run on Windows &amp;amp; Mac OSX with Java 7 or higher, but this has yet to be tested either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, the program logs all statements to standard output, so the display can become rather convoluted very quickly. Future versions will incorporate logging to a separate file as well as the verbosity level to use for logging. Additionally, I plan to incorporate a feature for emailing the session logs upon quitting as well as options for selecting different encryption ciphers, key lengths, and initial parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if you have any requests or bugs. You can contact me by email or through the Git Repo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Announcements</category><category>Java</category><category>Projects</category><category>WEEUp</category><guid>https://news.wiseeyesent.com/posts/2014/06/weeup_0-5.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2014 19:22:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Java Echo Server</title><link>https://news.wiseeyesent.com/posts/2014/04/java-echo-server.html</link><dc:creator>admin</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: This project has been lost&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I created a simple echo server&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was written by modifying a tutorial available on the Oracle site for socket programming. This is the first step to writing an authentication system capable of storing multiple users with secure login credentials and permitting these users to login to the system with an encrypted password. The project itself is a school lab for one of my co-workers and is being pursued both to assist my co-worker as well as to learn this type of system on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
