<p>NOTE: This page is currently under development and will be modified shortly. The project outline &amp; team positions will be changed from a “position” to a “task” format, focusing upon the tasks to be completed and the individuals currently working on them, rather than filling specific roles with individuals and requiring their full &amp; on-going participation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for my GSP410 Team Assignment, we will be documenting &amp; planning this project. Some team members may officially contribute to the project. All members will receive full credit for documentation, planning, development or other contributions as they are officially added to the project and released.</p>
<p>UPDATE 20120827: Final documentation has been submitted for the class. It is now available here: games.wiseeyesent.com/files/ProjectZed_Doc&amp;Des.docx
This documentation will be reviewed &amp; revised as necessary, but marks the first complete documentation for this project.
Thank you GSP410 SUMA Team A, for your hard work &amp; dilligence.

<p>UPDATE 20120815: We’re two weeks through the documentation. Stuff is looking pretty nice, actually! I’ll probably need to tweak it still, but we’ve been able to put together a time line for the project as well as diagramming several portions of the project. I’ll post the documentation up here when the class is finished.</p>

<p>Project: “Z” aka “Zed”</p>
<p>Premise: Zombie Side-Scroller, 8-bit, Mario meets zombies</p>
<p>Goal: Traverse level from start to finish while avoiding, incapacitating, killing or infecting any humans in the way</p>
<p>Description: The player will control “Zed”, just your slightly smarter than average undead ghoul, as he traverses 2-d levels and attempts to outwit, out-maneuver and otherwise catch the humans unawares. Humans are capable of quickly killing the player, both at a range and in close proximity. Attacking humans takes time, and leaves the player vulnerable. Infecting humans, may or may not, result in zombie allies.</p>
<p>Platform: Java developed for online browser play and multi-platform support for mobile devices and any operating system/browser with support for Java.</p>
<p>Controls: WASD interface or arrow keys, plus Space bar, Ctrl, Alt, etc.</p>
<p>Abilities: Walk, crawl, feign death (detectable), burrow (not detectable), scratch, bite, devour (restore health? currently undecided)</p>

<p>Currently, I have a few friends and individuals interested in helping out with the project, primarily with the programming aspects (writing the game in Java). The game will need a graphics engine, sound engine, NPC (Human &amp; Zombie) AI engine as all as the overall game engine. This project will also require a 2-d artist and level designer, may need a concept artist, will require a sound artist for effects, ambiance and music.</p>
<p>Please contact me by email at jcripe (A) wiseeyesent.com if you are interested in participating or have suggestions. I will be making a page reflecting this information shortly with ongoing updates to the project &amp; team.</p>
