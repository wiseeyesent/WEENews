<p>Here’s a list of my recommendations. Please feel free to contact me if any of the links don’t work, you find any incorrect information or have your own recommendations for me.

<p>SECURITY SOFTWARE -
<a href="http://www.lavasoft.com/products/ad_aware_free.php">Lavasoft Ad-Aware</a> A comprehensive, lightweight and effective anti-malware program. I used it for years when I was still running Windows and never had any complaints. Malware protection includes viruses, spyware and adware. Also offers “basic real time protection” with the free version.

<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php">Malwarebytes Anti-Malware</a> Another anti-malware program. I’ve only recently begun using it to remove <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-personal-internet-security-2011">Personal Internet Security 2011</a> for WiseEyes Ent’s first client. Recommended by <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer.com</a> so it must be effective. Malware protection is limited to spyware and adware, and the free version doesn’t include real time protection, unfortunately.
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php">Features List</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products.php">Product List</a></p>
<p><a href="http://download.cnet.com/Avast-Free-Antivirus/3000-2239_4-10019223.html?part=dl-85737&amp;subj=dl&amp;tag=button">Avast Anti-Virus</a> Another product I have some history with. I highly recommend Avast over Norton &amp; McAfee since it is more lightweight and secure. If a virus is going to be written to block or disable anti-virus software, the programmer is far more likely to target Norton &amp; McAfee since these are the 2 most common and come pre-installed on computers. Using other anti-virus software, such as Ad-Aware &amp; Avast Anti-Virus, helps prevent this issue due to the smaller scale that these products are implemented. Furthermore, they tend to be far more lightweight applications and thus better for multi-tasking with, especially if you’re on a system with limited resources (such as a netbook). Avast still offers free Virus &amp; Spyware protection, but does charge for other features. <a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4">Comparison Chart</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.avast.com/products#tab3">Product List</a></p>
<p><a href="http://greatis.com/security/reanimator.html">Greatis Software RegRun Reanimator</a> An incredibly powerful and in-depth piece of security software. It will run through files, registry and rootkits, allowing the user to make changes or leave them alone at each step of the way. It’s so good, in fact, that you can really mess up your computer if you’re not careful. This piece of software saved my computer when I got a serious virus infection back in 2005 (Freshman year at ASU). I had to run through items one by one and double checked everything I didn’t recognize with Google searches. DO NOT make random changes or change something you’re not sure about! I’ve seen someone else wreck his computer worse by doing so. The interface is a little awkward and lacks polish, but the efficiency and power of this software is so incredible, I really couldn’t care less. Hell, I’d run it on a command line UI, Zork style, if I had to, because it gets the job done.

<p>ONLINE STORAGE -
<a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">DropBox.com</a> An absolute favourite of mine ever since it saved my writing during the epic hard-drive failure of Nano 2010. A free account will get you 2GB of space and then you can download the client for your computer. The client will place a “Dropbox” folder on your system (anywhere you choose) and automatically sync all the files for this folder with your online account and any other computers that you have linked to your account with the client running. I use it for a lot of my school work and programming, since I can seamlessly edit files on multiple computers (Mac PowerPC and Ubuntu Netbook) without having to do anything other than saving them. All changes are transferred automatically to other connected systems and Dropbox stores a very comprehensive file history on its website.

<p><a href="http://www.sendspace.com/">SendSpace.com</a> A handy service for sending large files to others. They host your file temporarily and provide a download link that can be automatically e-mailed to yourself or a recipient. This service may be used with or without an account.
<a href="http://www.sendspace.com/register.html">Free</a> and <a href="https://www.sendspace.com/premium_upgrade.html">Payed</a> accounts are available.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> The internet search mogul extraordinare. Google offers free e-mail accounts, free blogs, free books and an obscene listing of other free software and apps to suit almost any need. Google also heavily supports the independent developers, allowing them to host an even more obscene listing of third party apps.
<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/options/">Full List of Services</a></p>
<p>BROWSERS -
<a href="http://www.google.com/chrome?hl=en&amp;brand=CHMI">Google Chrome</a> A very secure, stable, lightweight and sleek looking internet browser. I’ve been using it since its original public beta release and really enjoy it. Google did a wonderful job streamlining the interface on this browser. The biggest issue to date is that it doesn’t fully support some scripting languages or streaming files. So not always so hot if you like watching a lot of online movies. I still highly recommend this browser, but if you run into problems, you can run Mozilla Firefox as well.
Bonus Points - Google released a lovely little <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/index.html">Comic</a> detailing the development process, ideas and features behind Chrome.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> Kicking Internet Explorer’s ass for years! Firefox was the original (as far as I know, feel free to correct me if wrong) tabbed browser. Furthermore, it adds a lot of improved security and stability over Internet Explorer. The addition of add ons such as <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/httpfox/">HTTPFox</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/">NoScript</a> make it even more versatile, safe and efficient.
Bonus Points- <a href="http://www.downloadhelper.net/">Video Download Helper</a> add on for Firefox. Download streaming media directly from within your browser. ‘Nuff said.</p>
