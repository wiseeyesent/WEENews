<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">Improving Human/Computer relations and enabling digito-analog expression.</p>

<h1><strong>More Info</strong></h1>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">WiseEyes Enterprise is a diverse collection of works and support offered by Joshua A. Cripe West. Focus is intended to start primarily on personal game projects and proceed to more collaborative efforts on movies, music, photography, writing or any other form of creative expression. Currently, the brunt of work being performed involve support for associates, web development, and miscellaneous utilities intended for practice purposes rather than commercial or general use.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">The name originates from the game <a title="Uplink on Steam" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/1510/" target="_blank">Uplink</a> by Introversion Software. The name WiseEyes was chosen as a player alias for this title alone. Later, when trying to decide upon a domain, Enterprise was added to emphasize the intended growth of the organization to include production of multi-media projects as a means of enabling the individual's creative expression.</p></body></html><html><body><p>

<p>"Don't be afraid of technology. Just try stuff."<br/>
-Joshua</p>

<p>"One thing I've learned is to always make a backup first."<br/>
-JAC West</p>

<p>JAC West was born at a very early age as Joshua Andrew Cripe in East Texas. His childhood involved moving between Texas and Tennessee to finally settle in Corpus Christi, where he graduated high school and enlisted in the Army Reserves. After training was completed, he moved to Arizona State University, where he pursued a Computer Science degree. Sadly, due to extenuating circumstances involving a deployment to Iraq in 2008 and a World of Warcraft subscription prior to this, he was unable to complete his degree at this institution.</p>

<p>Upon returning to the United States, Joshua met his now wife, Kahrheena. The two struck a cord instantly and she encouraged him to return to his studies through DeVry University online. This facilitated their subsequent nomadic period living in several locations over the course of 9 months, including Albuquerque, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and a brief stay over in New York City. In 2012, Joshua moved with his wife to Austin for a Jr. Administrator position with HostGator.com, where he was employed for almost 4 years.</p>

<p>Later that year, a degree in Game &amp; Simulations Programming was completed after three years of study. This moment represented the culmination of his childhood interest in computing and digital games, which originated on his family PC with titles such as <a title="Commander Keen: Goodbye Galaxy via RGB Classic Games" href="https://www.classicdosgames.com/online/4keen.html" target="_blank">Commander Keen</a> and <a title="Major Styker via RGB Classic Games" href="https://www.classicdosgames.com/online/strykerfw.html" target="_blank">Major Stryker</a>. Continued interest in gaming went on to include a variety of genres from Doom, Command &amp; Conquer, and The Neverhood to Super Mario 64, Mech Warrior, and Half-Life. This pastime directly contributed to his interest in computing, resulting in the disruption of various family computers. Eventually, he learned to fix them as well and currently works as a Linux Administrator.</p>
