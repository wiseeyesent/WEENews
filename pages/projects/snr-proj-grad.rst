.. type: text

Finally, after 6 years spent at 2 different schools, I have completed my Bachelor’s of Science degree! My last class with DeVry for the Game & Simulation Programming program (a little redundant, no?) ended on February 28th. As a result, I now bring you the next game in my library, Escape from Area 52! This project was intended to be a Beta release so it’s still very buggy, particularly the sound effects, graphics and some NPC collision detection.

NEXT UP!
I’ll be working on a standalone page for this title complete with documentation & any possible future developments (highly unlikely, but I could get bored).

Project Zed is still in the works and now that I’ve finished school, I’ll have more time to kick out something extra awesome, or at least playable.
